## Holaa

Here is some composition of this blog that I use for:

- Gatsby (Static Generator)
- React (Front End)
- GraphQL (Query Language - Make your static data query able)
- Netlify (Hosting)
- Emotion (JSS Styling)

But, actually I do some spy ðŸ˜Š -ing to the repo of two popular blog that use gatsby which is Kent C Dods Blog & Overreacted. Keep silent please :)

I think that is normal for the composition stack but if you still curious go ahead check [this repo](https://github.com/arrlancore/arlan.net), may be you can improve my code.
